The most recent example, and the one that has caused great anxiety on the international scene, is that relatively small but violent groups of fanatics have taken as hostages altogether innocent people, both as passengers on civil aircraft and even representatives of foreign States on legal assignments. These victims of violence have been kept in captivity for the purpose of blackmail to force acceptance of outrageous demands of a more or less illegal nature. And the criminal commandos have threatened the hostages with injury and even death if their demands are not satisfied. I consider that all relations with nations that tolerate such kidnapping will be imperiled. Some measures will have to be found to prevent this violence. On the other hand, one cannot overlook the fact that many of those who have taken these violent actions live in great difficulties and suffer even injustice, so that it is not by any means unnatural that they resort to desperate actions. But one cannot under any circumstances
tolerate this. Their problems will have to be solved by other means. Violence serves no useful purposes but will have grave consequences for those who resort to it. Something will have to be done.

That reasoning is based on a false analogy. The Kaaba was built by the prophet Abraham for the worship of the one true God, and later generations added the idols. The Prophet Muhammad was commanded to purify the Kaaba of those idols for its use by his followers and to bring it back to its original form. The historical sites being destroyed by the so-called Islamic State were never used for the worship of the one God and then later desecrated, so the argument for destroying them does not and cannot apply. Moreover, God informs us that the sites that we travel to and that denote past civilizations, some of which were global super-Powers in their time but are that no longer, are signs that remind us not to be arrogant, but to walk the earth humbly.
