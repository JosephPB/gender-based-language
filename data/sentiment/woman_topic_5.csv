23,"We greatly appreciate the candor with which the Secretary  General in 
his report has brought to our notice the shortcomings of the 
Organization. We in Bangladesh will support the Secretary General in 
all his efforts to make the United Nations an effective organization 
for maintaining world peace and security. Bangladesh has chosen non 
alignment as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. We are committed 
to working tirelessly together with other peace loving nations of the 
world to create an environment of peace in which people can harness 
all available resources to combat the scourge of poverty, hunger, 
disease and illiteracy, thus achieving economic freedom without 
sacrificing political freedom. As at previous sessions this year, 
too, we have a long agenda and we are very conscious of the number of 
crucial issues before us. We notice a progressive decline in the 
international situation. There is widespread use offence, the 
continuing existence of foreign occupation forces and acts of 
aggression, total disregard for the principle of self determination, 
and flouting of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the 
Security Council. The situation prevailing in the Middle East remains 
dangerous and highly explosive, posing a serious threat to 
international peace and security. This state of affairs is due to the 
persistence of Israel in its flagrant denial of the inalienable 
rights of the Palestinian people, as recognized by the United 
Nations. The latest Israeli holocaust in Lebanon has rendered the 
situation in the Middle East more explosive than ever before. Along 
with the peoples of all peace loving nations, we in Bangladesh have 
been stunned by the appalling act of inhuman massacre of a large 
number of innocent and unarmed Palestinian men, women and children in 
their camps in west Beirut. The Government of Bangladesh is of the 
view that the question of Palestine constitutes the core of the 
Middle East problem. There can be no just and lasting peace in the 
Middle East unless the Palestinian people can exercise their 
legitimate rights, including the right to return to their homeland, 
their right to self determination and to establish a State of their 
own under the leadership of the PLO their sole and legitimate 
representative, with Jerusalem as its capital. Further, the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force imposes an 
obligation on Israel to withdraw completely from all the territories 
it has occupied since 1967, including the Holy City of Jerusalem. Any 
solution that fails to recognize these rights and realities will pose 
a constant threat to peace and stability in the region. We are 
particularly distressed at the continuing and self defeating armed 
conflict between Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Bangladesh, 
as a member of the Islamic Peace Committee, has made sincere efforts 
to resolve that conflict peacefully. It is a great tragedy that 
despite our collective efforts the war is still continuing. We should 
like to make a renewed appeal to Iran and Iraq to stop this armed 
conflict forthwith and to resolve their differences through peaceful 
means. It is also extremely disheartening that the crises in 
Afghanistan and in Kampuchea remain unresolved. We should do 
everything possible to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops 
from those two countries and to ensure that the people in both those 
countries are permitted to determine their own destinies without any 
outside intervention or interference. We firmly believe that peace is 
possible In southern Africa only through the transfer of power to the 
people of Namibia. We appreciate the sustained mediatory efforts of 
the five Western Powers in evolving an agreement on Namibia's 
transition to independence under the control and supervision of the 
United Nations. It is the view of Bangladesh that peace and security 
would be promoted through the creation of zones of peace in areas 
like the Indian Ocean, South Asia and South East Asia, the 
Mediterranean and other regions. Such zones would have to take into 
account the interrelated aspects of eliminating the military presence 
of and threat from external Powers and the maintenance of security 
among the regional States. In this context, we support the convening 
of a conference in Sri Lanka next year as a step towards the 
implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of 
Peace. Bangladesh has also been making unrelenting efforts to promote 
peace and stability in the South Asian region through the creation of 
a climate of trust, understanding and co operation on the basis of 
mutual respect for sovereign equality and non interference in the 
internal affairs of other States. Taking into account our friendly 
relations within our region with India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri 
Lanka and Maldives, Bangladesh has proposed the creation of a 
regional co operation forum among those countries. Substantial 
progress has been made towards the implementation of this proposal, 
and the necessary preparatory work is still under way for making the 
process self  sustaining and irreversible. It has also been decided 
to convene a meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers next year to 
launch the forum. We believe that our statement on global issues 
would be incomplete if we did not say a few words about our national 
efforts to achieve a better living for our people. Mr. H. M. Ershad, 
on assumption of the office of the head of Government of Bangladesh,

maximum benefit to the 90 million people of Bangladesh; secondly, to 
ensure maximum participation by the people of the country through 
existing political institutions and, thirdly, to create a simple, 
well balanced administration capable of responding to the needs of 
the people. In order to achieve these objectives, the Government of
