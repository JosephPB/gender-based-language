'In Cambodia, there simply does not exist the recognition of civil liberties or human rights on a basis recognized by the world community,' said Floyd Abrams, the constitutional expert and First Amendment lawyer, who is a member of the American team ... 'When you put together a society,' Mr. Abrams said in an interview on Tuesday, 'in which people are arrested without charges being made and jailed without being convicted, in which confessions are forced and torture seems to be commonplace, you simply are not talking about a society that seriously recognizes the rule of law.' ... Vietnamese are playing an extensive role in the security apparatus of the Phnom Penh Government. Vietnamese were reported present o- actively taking part in every interrogation and torture ... Torture methods, according to former prisoners, included electric shocks, being trussed up and suspended from the ceiling while being beaten, being shackled by the legs to stirrups above the floor to force the body into a painful off-balance position and having a plastic bag pulled over the head and closed around the neck until the prisoner fainted. Some prisoners reportedly died of beatings, others from malnutrition and disease.'

national defense work - a euphemism for an ambitious Vietnamese plan to seal the 'Shai-Kaspuchea border ... Diplomats ... have confirmed the reports ... h Khmer doctor who recently defected from Phnom Penh claims each of Cansbodia' s provinces is committed to supplying up to 25,000 to 30,000 workers over an unspecified period of time to build and repair access roads, clear jungle, lay minefields, and construct elaborate anti-infiltration barriers along the malaria-infested frontier. Conscripts range in age from 18 to 45 and there is general agreement that quotas have been established for each district, ranging as high as 3,000 ... Disease is apparently so rampant that many of the medical workers themselves go down with malaria, hepatitis and viral infections and are unable to work for weeks after their return ... The death rate among the labor conscripts is unknown but diplomatic sources say many are wounded by mines ... Medical supplies are also reported to be inadequate to deal with the sick, the bulk of whom contract malaria on top of other complaints ... So Saren, former deputy director of Phnom Penh's 500-bed Kampuchean-Soviet Friendship Hospital, said the forced labor program was initiated in March 1984 ... So claimed opposition to the labor program is muted but widespread. Western aid workers and other independent sources confirm what they say is a tremendous amount of bitterness over the Vietnamese-directed plan, particularly the way women are being conscripted to make up the work force quotas. One of the more prominent critics, according to So, was the regime's late Prime Minister, Chan Sy, who is said to have complained to the Vietnamese that it would lead to an unacceptable number of deaths.

Today, not just my country, but the whole of the Balkans and Europe are faced with thousands of refugees — children, women, elderly people and entire families who are fleeing the bloodshed in their home countries. Since the beginning of 2015, nearly 200,000 people, mainly Syrians, have transited through the Republic of Macedonia. Syria’s neighbours Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan are also heavily affected. The first signs of that heavy social burden are now being felt in the Balkan countries, whose economies cannot cope with the situation on their own.",2015,negative,-0.910162,"{'sadness': 0.665499, 'joy': 0.027671, 'fear': 0.217328, 'disgust': 0.353337, 'anger': 0.013894}"
576,"Further to the issue of poverty eradication, I would like to add that one of the most impactful interventions we can make in the war against poverty is by empowering women, who, although representing half of the world’s population, account for nearly 70 per cent of the world’s poor. In Namibia, gender equality is not merely lip service. We have benefitted from SWAPO’s internal reform of its party list system to include the 50-50 per cent representation of women. Due to the SWAPO victory at the national electoral polls, female representation in our Parliament has increased from 24 per cent to 47 per cent, second only to Rwanda, which has up to 64 per cent female representation in its Parliament.

577,"In order to implement the new Agenda it is essential to allocate sufficient resources. We need to increase the budgets for programmes that involve social inclusion, especially in the fields of health and education, giving priority to the care of our children, gender equality and the empowerment of women. Peru considers it vital to adopt at the twenty-first meeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December, a universally binding, ambitious and balanced agreement to address climate change. As the current Acting President of that Conference, Peru is sparing no effort to reach that goal, in accordance with the Lima Call for Climate Action. Climate change and environmental challenges are endless. The experts say that we will be facing a particularly serious situation with regard to El Niño over the next few years. We must invest more in disaster prevention and risk reduction as part of our development plans.
