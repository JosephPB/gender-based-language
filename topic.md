The UN General Assembly statements contain information on a lot of topics, however, some are more prevalent than others since Member states will ususally talk about the pressing issues of global politics, some of which change a lot, and other which do not. Themes within, and between, statements can therefore be found, and the development of these themes can be monitored throughout the 46 years of data that we have. Some topics will be relatively consistent over time, such as discussions around nuclear weapons and the Israel-Palestine Conflict, however, others will be more dynamic, such as the topic of law that transitions from discussions on maritime law in the 1970s to the war on drugs in the 1990s.

In identiying these topics we performed no manual categorisation, rather the statements were split into paragraphs and automatically clustered based on their language, context, and lingustic properties. This means that, sometimes, trends and shifts in topic discussions may require some thought to understand the logic behind the transitions, however, this methodolgy gives a less subjective categorisation of documents, and can sometimes pick up more subtle trends and linkages in discussions, than a human might.

The following topics have been identified as case studies:

More topics are under development.
