The UN General Assembly statements contain information on a lot of topics, however, some are more prevalent than others since Member states will ususally talk about the most personally pressing issues of global politics. Themes within and between statements can therefore be found, and the development of these themes can be monitored throughout the 46 years of data that we have. Some topics will be relatively consitent over time, such as discussions around nuclear weapons and the Israel-Palestine Conflict, however, others will be more dynamic, such as the topic of law that transitions from discussions on maritime law in the 1970s to the war on drugs in the 1990s.

In identiying these topics we performed no manual categorisation, rather the statements were split into paragraphs and automatically cluster the paragraphs based on their language, context, and lingustic properties. This means that sometimes the trends in topics may require some thought to understand the logic behind the transition, however, this methodolgy gives a less subject categorisation of documents, and can sometimes pick up more subtle trends and linkages in discussions than a human might.

The following topics have been identified:

[Human Rights](/topics/topic_3/)

[The Israel-Palestine Conflict](/topics/topic_5/)
