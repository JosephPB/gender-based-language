title: Topics Overview
---

The statements made at the UN General Assembly contain information on a wide vairety of topics, however, some are more prevalent than others since Member states will ususally talk about the pressing issues of global politics. Within these topics of conversation some change a lot over time, while others do not. We aim to identify the more prominent themes, and track their development throughout the 46 years of data that we have. Some topics will be relatively consistent over time, such as discussions around nuclear weapons and the Israel-Palestine conflict, however, others will be more dynamic, such as the topic of law that transitions from discussions on maritime law in the 1970s to the war on drugs in the 1990s.

In identiying these themes, or topics, we performed no manual categorisation, rather the statements were split into paragraphs and automatically clustered based on their language, context, and other lingustic properties. This means that, sometimes, trends and shifts in a topic's discussions may require some thought to understand the logic behind the transitions. An advantage of this methodology, however, is that it gives a less subjective categorisation of documents, and can sometimes pick up more subtle trends and linkages in discussions, than a human might.

The following topics have been identified as case studies:
