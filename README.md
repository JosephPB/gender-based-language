# Gender Related Language

## Introduction

By analysing the statements made by world leaders at the UN General Assembly from 1970-2015, we track a variety of topics that have been of continued discussion throughout this period and review how they have changed. Specifically, we investigate how woman and children are being referred to in this context, both within the aforementioned topics as well as more globally in the context of the entire text.
