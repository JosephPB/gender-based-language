title: UNGA Statements
---

The UN General Assembly has been a forum for global leaders to make statements on topics of their choosing since its inception. The statements hold the key to what nations feel are the important issues of the time and therefore present an informative source of information. Additioanlly, not only are these statements indicative of the conerns of the member states, they are also representative of direction of the UN as a whole. Since the UN is steered by the wishes of the member states, these statements demonstrate the possible future directions of the UN's actions and internal conversations.

We have access to every UN General Assembly speech available in English made between 1970-2015 inclusive. This dataset is available to download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/un-general-debates/home). Analysis of this dataset is preliminary and the aim is to provide insights into potential conclusions which may be drawn from such textual analysis, with a distinct emphasis on identifying how women and children may shape the debate, as well as the general use of gendered language within these statements. We will analyse the following:

- The overall frequency of terms in the corpus (see [Term Analysis](/term_analysis/))
- A selection of themes running throughout the debates over the 46 years presented here (see [Topics](/topic/))
- The shift in context of certain gender-related terms
