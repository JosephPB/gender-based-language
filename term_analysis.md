title: Term Analysis

The use of language has changed significantly since 1970. In particular we have seen a change in the use of gender related term in high leel discussions. For instance, conversations involving references to women have seen a large increase, whereas the use of specifically male terminology has decreased. This latter point is not necessarily becuase men are being talked about less, but likely due to a shift towards the use of more inclusive language.

There has also been an increase in coversation around children. Indeed, we see a strong correlation between the overall use of female and child related terminology.
