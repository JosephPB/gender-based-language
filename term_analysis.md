title: Term Analysis

The use of language has changed significantly since 1970. In particular we have seen a change in the use of gender related terms in high level discussions. For instance, conversations involving references to women have seen a large increase, whereas the use of specifically male terminology has decreased. This latter point is not necessarily becuase men are being talked about less, but likely due to a shift towards the use of more inclusive language.

    <div style="float:right;width:49%">

    </div>
</div>

There has also been an increase in coversation around children. Indeed, we see a strong correlation between the overall use of *woman* and *child* related terminology.

    </div>
</div>

We can also identify which nations are referring to *women* in their statements.

**Note:** Since the UN has gained member states each year, this map only reflects the statements made between 2000-2015

We can also examine whether leaders are talking more of cooperation, or if issues are raised without the explicit mention of working together to solve them. There are various indicators that can be used to analyse this, one being the use of collective language. 

Since the beginning of our period of analysis, leaders have increasingly used terms such as *global* and *globalisation*, as references to the increasing interconnectedness of the world.

However, the use of collective terms such as *people* and *cooperation* does not follow the same trend.

<div class="container">
    <div style="float:left;width:49%">
	    <img src="../data/frequency/people_frequency.svg">
    </div>
    <div style="float:right;width:49%">
	    <img src="../data/frequency/cooperation_frequency.svg">
    </div>
</div>

This could be indicative of *global* being used without the actual promotion of colaboration.
