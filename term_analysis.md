title: Term Analysis

The use of language has changed significantly since 1970. In particular we have seen a change in the use of gender related terms in high level discussions. For instance, conversations involving references to women have seen a large increase, whereas the use of specifically male terminology has decreased. This latter point is not necessarily becuase men are being talked about less, but likely due to a shift towards the use of more inclusive language.

    </div>
</div>

There has also been an increase in coversation around children. Indeed, we see a strong correlation between the overall use of *woman* and *child* related terminology.

    <div style="float:right;width:49%">
	    <img src="../data/frequency/woman_child_frequency.svg">
    </div>
</div>

Leaders have also increasingly used terms such as *global* and *globalisation*, as references to the increasing interconnectedness of the world.

However, the use of collective terms does not follow the same trend.

<div class="container">
    <div style="float:left;width:49%">
	    <img src="../data/frequency/people_frequency.svg">
    </div>
    <div style="float:right;width:49%">
	    <img src="../data/frequency/cooperation_frequency.svg">
    </div>
</div>

This could be indicative of *global* being used without the actual promotion of colaboration.
