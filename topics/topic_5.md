### Analysis

Discussions around the conflict between Israel and Palestine have been ongoing for decades. Over this period the discussion has shifted based on the intifadas, peace agreement negotiations, and differences in opinion. For instance, we see that discussions around a 'two-state-solution' began to rise in prominance around the time of the roadmap discussions, affirmed in UNSC Resolution 1397 (2002), and the 'Agreement on Movement Action' (AMA) in 2005.

However, although the term *solution* is increasing in prominance after the period of the AMA, conversations around *peace* and *future* begin to decrease. This linguistic shift could be an example of leaders becoming less forward looking, and more concentrating on the task of 'solving' the situation.

Similar analysis can be performed on the sentiment of the speeches around this topic. As would be expected, we see an increase in sentiment around the peace-talk periods, with negative and low-positive sentiment scores around the time of the Lebanon War and the First Intifada.

Despite these generally positive sentiment, statements focusing on women and overwhelmingly negative, only picking up slightly around the period of peace talks. This may be indicative of how woman, in many conflict situations, are generally percieved as victims.

Additionlly, this is reinforced by the strong negative sentiments when speaking about women during the Lebanon War. The overall paragraph sentiment is lower just prior to this period, and then generally neutral during it, however, paragraphs mentioning women are far from neural in sentiment.
