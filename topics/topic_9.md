### Analysis

Resouce allocation is, unsurprisingly, an issue continually talked about in UNGA statements. Over time different factors affect the allocation of resources, both financial and physical. For instance, in the 1970s many statements referred to an increase in debt and a decrease in growth, with much conversation focused around the end of the 'First Development Decade' and the beginning of the second.

>The foreign debt of the developing countries, created by large export credits and development aid, has rapidly increased to almost 50 billion dollars, while the servicing of these debts has increased at the rate of 17 percent per annum, according to the Pearson report, which was drawn up by a high ranking commission of experts of the World Bank. The first Development Decade does not offer much reason for enthusiasm in most countries.

As we see from the keywords used above, the term *refugee* begins to appear for the first time in the 1980s, and food shortages begin entering the conversations.

>In Somalia we continue to face the problem of dealing with the largest refugee population in the world. The number of refugees currently being cared for in and outside camps has passed the one and a half million mark and continues to increase steadily, with a daily influx of well over 1,000 refugees arriving at camps. Since we were already experiencing the difficulties of underdevelopment, world inflation and natural disasters, it can be readily understood that this refugee problem has placed a quite intolerable burden on our country.

>The problem of the lack of water is at present the most crucial one, both for human beings and for cattle. The lack of water has devastating effects on the sole resource of the population. In fact, between 20,000 and 25,000 persons have lost all their livestock and are at present grouped in nine camps, and the Government must help them to meet all their needs. Water and food assistance must be provided to more than 100,000 persons who have lost a considerable percentage of their livestock—approximately 80 per cent.

In the 1990s and 2000s we see a continuation of discussions around food shortages, along with a linkage being made between suffering and climate change. This latter point is shown through *enviroment* becoming a keyword in 1990, as well as *climate* and *change* dominating in 2010-2015.

>The small island States of the Caribbean are
among those countries most at risk from the adverse
effects of climate change. Already, many of our islands
are experiencing those effects in areas that impact
directly on the important tourism sector of our
economies. We are also prone to extremely damaging
natural disasters, especially hurricanes and storm
surges, which visit us annually with increasing
frequency and ferocity. Our diverse region also
experiences droughts and floods, volcanic eruptions
and earthquakes, with equally devastating effects, if
less regularly than the pleasantly named perennials.

>But times are changing and the world has witnessed in recent months and years an epic outbreak of horrific natural disasters unprecedented in the 70-year history of our Organization. Tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding, bush fires and droughts have resulted in the loss of countless lives and untold sorrow and suffering. Especially noteworthy is the fact that developed countries are no longer insulated from the reach and destructive force of these events. Some countries and regions have been visited by climate-related and natural events like cyclones, bush fires, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, tornados, and so on.

Additioanlly, we see that women and children gain prominance in the statements at around the same time in this topic. Indeed, it is no cooincidence that *people*, *child* and *aid* are present in the top keywords during the same periods. Woman are entering into the conversation, along with chilren, portrayed as victims. 

>One of the areas of particular concern to Cyprus
is the increasing number of refugees and internally
displaced persons throughout the world. Cyprus has
itself experienced the tragic consequences of mass
displacement and ethnic cleansing. The vast majority
of displaced people — more than 22 million people,
according to the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees — are women and
children, who are particularly vulnerable to gross
violations of their human rights. We strongly believe
that the international community has an obligation to
more forcefully secure the right of return of these
refugees to their places of residence.

Additionally, in the late 1990s and 2000s conversations around climate change, and natural disasters shift away from the problems of crop yields towards one of human suffering at the level of death.

The notion of referring to women as victims is further reinforced by the fact that we see a surge in negative sentiment in paragraphs discussing women at the same time as the word useage is becoming more prominent. It is notable that this spike in negativity is not seen to the same extent in the overall sentiment analysis chart, highlighting the correlation of negative sentiment particualrly when referring to women and children, relative to other paragraphs in this topic.
