### Paragraphs

#### 1970

>Peace is no longer a simple ideal, a dream or a Utopian scheme. It has become the most pressing, the most elementary, of all needs. It has ceased to be an objective and has become a premise. Either we have a peaceful future before us or we run the risk of having no future at all. It is no longer a matter of evoking ideals of self-denial and altruism. It is no longer a matter of emphasizing the necessity for moral and political advances to match the prodigious scientific and technological progress of our day. It is a matter of appealing to the fundamental interest of man, to his instinct for self-preservation, for what is really at stake is the survival of man.

>Therefore we must create in this ever-shrinking world the conditions necessary for us all to live together and flourish. Is that a dream? How many dreams have become realities? And does not mankind need lofty dreams in order to transcend itself and draw nearer to peace, greater justice and greater progress?

#### 1980

>We have come some way but have a long way to go. We have made some progress but the end of the journey is still far. But reach it we must. Since the beginning of human history the world has been full of conflicts, disputes and wars. This is the tragedy of human existence. The big question is can man ever live with his neighbour in perfect harmony? Can areas of conflict be reduced? In short: can wars be avoided? Some may answer yes; others may say no. Whatever our answer may be, one thing cannot be disputed: that we stand to gain in a world of peace and to lose in a world of war. We must therefore commit ourselves to ensuring peace in the world.

>The experience which Peru lived through during that time became a subject of examination and expectation throughout the world and is a lesson which should not go unnoticed in this universal forum. It proves that the desire to move forward in search of social justice, in countries such as ours, does not come from the imposition of ideological conceptions which claim arbitrarily to interpret collective anxieties and satisfy collective needs. It shows that, however good intentions may be, the will of the people must be ascertained directly. This has proved once again that, without freedom, control and preservation of the national interest are relaxed and the wellbeing of the vast majority becomes a mere dream. The struggle for justice and the quest for egalitarian values must go hand in hand with an affirmation of freedom and must be reconciled with the full enjoyment of human rights.

#### 1990

>But we should not be mesmerised by these happy changes. We must now knuckle down to the mundane task of making these changes a part of everyday life, of our habits of thought and our instinctive sense of reality. We cannot yet be sure of the permanence or the full consequences of the 'velvet' revolutions around the world. We need to remember that the great Chinese statesman Chou En-lai, when asked what he thought of the French Revolution, replied, 'It is too soon to tell'. I am not suggesting that we need 200 years for reflection, but I am sure we would be wise to proceed with caution and with caution, renewed determination.

>In the midst of the immense chaos that the French Revolution caused in Europe two centuries ago, in a world suddenly left without points of reference and threatened by new forms of despotism, a philosopher of that age and of all ages enthusiastically but cautiously distinguished between universal law, the promise of everlasting peace among nations and respect for the freedom of all. Today, when the end of the cold war is changing the world's geopolitics, when the people of Eastern Europe are once again finding the magnificence and the risks of freedom and when, at the same time, the danger of a war with unprecedented consequences is emerging and new problems are gaining priority, we must return to the principles of that centuries-old perception.

#### 2000

>By far the most difficult challenge in protecting
civilians in armed conflict is in situations where abuse
is most severe: genocide, war crimes, crimes against
humanity, massive and systematic violations of human
rights and humanitarian law which cause widespread
suffering, loss of life and abuse.

>Some believe that violence might be an intrinsic
part of humanity. But so are humanity's relentless
efforts to rule out violence, regulate antagonism,
peacefully resolve confrontational situations and
prevent hatred and prejudice. Whether we come
together to understand each other or to debate each
other, our goal has always been to better our lives and
build a more secure future.

#### 2010

>There are cynics who say that the world cannot 
live together, that for peace to exist we must build 
walls of separation between peoples, religions and 
ethnic communities; cynics who say that civilizations 
must clash. I come from a country that is in a turbulent 
part of the world, yet we have managed to prove that 
people of different religions — Christians, Muslims 
and Jews, and of different ethnicities — Bulgarians, 
Turks and Armenians, can live together.

>Chile is a country that today is living through 
times that are historic and dramatic and offer enormous 
opportunities. I say historic times because only five 
days ago we commemorated our two-hundredth 
anniversary of independence and opened the doors to 
our third century of republican life. We did so as one 
big family saluting the same flag, honouring the same 
heroes and singing the same national anthem 
irrespective of our political ideas, religious beliefs, 
ethnic origin or economic situation.

#### 2015

>I recognize that democracy is going to take different forms in different parts of the world. The very idea of a people governing themselves depends upon government giving expression to their unique culture, their unique history, their unique experiences. But some universal truths are self-evident. No person wants to be imprisoned for peaceful worship. No woman should ever be abused with impunity, no girl should be barred from attending school. There should be freedom to peacefully petition those in power without fear of arbitrary laws. These are not ideas of one country or one culture. They are fundamental to human progress. They are a cornerstone of this institution.

>Islam condemns the destruction of historical sites that are part of the world’s cultural heritage. The lies of the so-called Islamic State include the claim that it is their duty to destroy historical sites, because the Prophet Muhammad destroyed the idols that had been introduced into the Kaaba in Mecca. That reasoning is based on a false analogy. The Kaaba was built by the prophet Abraham for the worship of the one true God, and later generations added the idols. The Prophet Muhammad was commanded to purify the Kaaba of those idols for its use by his followers and to bring it back to its original form. The historical sites being destroyed by the so-called Islamic State were never used for the worship of the one God and then later desecrated, so the argument for destroying them does not and cannot apply. Moreover, God informs us that the sites that we travel to and that denote past civilizations, some of which were global super-Powers in their time but are that no longer, are signs that remind us not to be arrogant, but to walk the earth humbly. We must combat the so-called Islamic State and its warped ideology by explaining why their path is un-Islamic and why their actions are evil, theologically incoherent and a travesty of Islam, which commands us to be knowledgeable, compassionate and humble.
